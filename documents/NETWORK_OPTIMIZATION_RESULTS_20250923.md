## Test Commands

### Quick Performance Check
```bash
# Latency test
ping -c 10 100.84.202.68

# Throughput test
python3 /Volumes/DATA/FREEDOM/scripts/network_performance_test.py
```

### Apply Remaining Optimizations
```bash
# Apply TCP tuning
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=0
sudo sysctl -w kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=16777216
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.sendspace=1048576
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.recvspace=1048576

# Or apply all at once
sudo cp /Volumes/DATA/FREEDOM/config/sysctl_optimizations.conf /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

### Monitor Performance
```bash
# Real-time network monitoring
nettop -m tcp

# Check current TCP settings
sysctl net.inet.tcp | grep -E "sendspace|recvspace|delayed_ack"

# Docker network stats
docker stats --no-stream
```
