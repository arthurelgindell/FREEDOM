## ðŸ§  CCKS - Claude Code Knowledge System (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS RUN FIRST IN EVERY SESSION:**
```bash
# Load persistent memory (REQUIRED)
~/.claude/ccks stats > /dev/null 2>&1 || echo "CCKS not available"

# Capture session context
pwd | xargs -I {} ~/.claude/ccks add "Working in: {}"
git status 2>/dev/null | head -5 | xargs -I {} ~/.claude/ccks add "Git: {}"
```

**DURING SESSION - AUTO-CAPTURE PATTERNS:**
- After solving errors: `ccks add "SOLUTION: [description]"`
- After running commands: Pipe output to `ccks add`
- Before asking questions: Check `ccks query "[your question]"`

**TOKEN OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOL:**
1. Before processing any request, ALWAYS run: `ccks query "[user's question]"`
2. If cache hit (>85% similarity), use cached solution
3. After providing solution, ALWAYS run: `ccks add "[solution summary]"`

**PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:**
- Cache hit rate must exceed 50% after 10 queries
- Token reduction must exceed 80% on repeated queries
- All solutions must be persisted within 2 minutes (high velocity mode)
