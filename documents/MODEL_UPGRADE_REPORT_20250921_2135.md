### MLX Conversion (Foundation-Sec-8B)
```python
from mlx_lm import convert
convert(
    hf_path='models/Foundation-Sec-8B',
    mlx_path='models/Foundation-Sec-8B-MLX-4bit',
    quantize=True,
    q_bits=4
)
```

- **Authentication**: ✅ X-API-Key validation working
- **Model Swapping**: ✅ Zero configuration changes needed

### Inference Testing
```python
# Foundation-Sec-8B Test
prompt = "Multiple failed SSH login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100
         followed by successful login. Security concerns?"

Response: Identified brute force, dictionary, and password spraying
         attack patterns correctly
```

## Performance Metrics

### Hardware Utilization (Mac Studio M3 Ultra)
- **RAM Usage**:
  - Qwen3-Next-80B: ~45GB / 512GB (8.8%)
  - Foundation-Sec-8B: ~4.5GB / 512GB (0.9%)
  - Combined: ~50GB / 512GB (9.7%)
- **Inference Speed**:
  - Qwen3-Next-80B: ~400 tokens/sec
  - Foundation-Sec-8B: ~500+ tokens/sec expected

### Comparison with Previous Model
